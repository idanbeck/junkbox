# IGM 799 Exploration / Design

The goal of this class will be to explore Machine Learning concepts that can be applicable to 
game design, development and technology.  The course will begin with a 

## Topics to cover

## Course Structure

The course will consist of weekly lectures on a given topic, 3 assignments throughout the semester,
a semester project, and a mid-semester mid-term.  The course will be taught on the Epoch framework,
but either assignments or projects could be done on alternative platforms as well - so using the 
framework is not mandatory. 

The goal of the course is to go into intermediate depth on machine learning techniques and how they
may be applied in the context of real time simulation type applications.
